              Cabinâ€™s first city node sits on 28-acres of Texas Hill Country,  about 45 minutes outside of Austin. We like to think of the land, infrastructure, and buildings as our hardware stack. The land is a beautiful piece of nature with a seasonal creek, wildlife, and amazing stargazing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our city node has off-grid infrastructure, including solar energy, water and sewage treatment systems, and a private internet network providing &gt;200 Mbps of bandwidth. On top of this, we&apos;ve built custom modular prefab housing, designed from the ground up for a co-living community of independent creators. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Because we are building in an unincorporated area of Texas, there is very little regulation. The only government interaction required for this entire project was a septic & well permit, filed remotely for around $100.
