While the vast majority of a DAO&apos;s work should be accomplished via asynchronous, remote, distributed work, there is tremendous leverage in getting together face-to-face for strategic thinking, team bonding, and deep collaboration. Cabin is the DAO to help other DAOs accelerate their work by getting together IRL."
